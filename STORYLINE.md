### Dialogue & Educational Content:

#### Introduction:
**Advisor:** *"Welcome to the Savings & Budgeting Room! 🎉 This is where dreams become realities... or at least where your wallet becomes happy! Let's start with the basics: Do you know what a budget actually IS?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"It's like... a plan for money?"* ✅
2. *"Something boring adults talk about?"*
3. *"A magical money tree?"* 😂

#### Educational Dialogue 1:
**Advisor:** *(After choice 1)* *"Exactly! A budget is like a roadmap for your money! You tell it where to go instead of wondering where it went! 🗺️"*

**Advisor:** *(After choice 2)* *"Well, it CAN be boring if you make it boring! But we're going to make it FUN! Think of it like a video game strategy guide for real life! 🎮"*

**Advisor:** *(After choice 3)* *"Ha! I wish! But here's the thing - a budget IS kind of magical! It makes your money grow and work for you! Even better than a money tree! 🌳✨"*

### Quiz 1: The 50/30/20 Rule
**Advisor:** *"Alright, time for a quick quiz! The famous 50/30/20 rule says you should spend:*
- *50% on needs (like food, rent, bills)*
- *30% on wants (like games, snacks, fun stuff)*
- *20% on savings* 

*So if you make $1000 a month, how much should go to savings?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"$50"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Close! But that's only 5%. Try again!"*)
2. *"$200"* ✅ (Feedback: *"YES! That's exactly right! You're a budgeting genius! 🎉"*)
3. *"$500"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Whoa there! That's 50%, which is way too aggressive. The rule is 20%!"*)

### Scenario 1: Monthly Budget Challenge
**Advisor:** *"Okay, time for a REAL challenge! Imagine you're a duck living in the city. You make $1200/month. Here's what you NEED to pay:*
- *Rent: $600*
- *Food: $200*
- *Bills (utilities, phone): $150*
- *Transportation: $100*

*You have $150 left. What should you do with it?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"Save it all! $150 to savings!"* ✅ (Feedback: *"Perfect! Emergency fund, here you come! You're going places! 💰"*)
2. *"Buy that cool game I've been wanting! It's only $60!"* ⚠️ (Feedback: *"Well... maybe save $90 and spend $60? Balance is key! 🎮"*)
3. *"Treat myself! I deserve it after all!"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Hmm... while treating yourself is nice, saving should come first! Try to save at least some of it!"*)

### Quiz 2: Emergency Fund
**Advisor:** *"Great job! Now, an emergency fund is super important! It's like a safety net for when life throws you a curveball (or a breadcrumb in your case! 🦆). How much should you save in an emergency fund?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"Enough for 1 month of expenses"* ⚠️ (Feedback: *"Good start! But ideally, aim for 3-6 months! That way you're really protected!"*)
2. *"Enough for 3-6 months of expenses"* ✅ (Feedback: *"PERFECT! You've got this financial stuff figured out! 🏆"*)
3. *"Just enough for a pizza"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Ha! Nice try, but we need a bit more than that! 😂"*)

### Tips Section:
**Advisor:** *"Here are some pro tips to supercharge your savings:*
1. *💰 Pay yourself first - Save before you spend!*
2. *🎯 Set specific goals - "I want $500 by December"*
3. *📱 Use apps to track spending - knowledge is power!*
4. *🍕 Cook at home - It's cheaper AND healthier!*
5. *🎁 Wait 24 hours before buying wants - impulse buys are budget killers!*

## Scene 4: Credit & Debt Room 💳

**Background:** `Web/assets/backgrounds/LivingRoom.jpeg` (or create new background)

**Characters:**
- **User (Duck):** Right side
- **Credit Counselor (Dino or specialized character):** Left side

### Dialogue & Educational Content:

#### Introduction:
**Counselor:** *"Welcome to the Credit & Debt Room! This is where we talk about the C-word... Credit! And the D-word... Debt! Don't worry, they're not as scary as they sound! 😊"*

**Counselor:** *"First things first: Do you know what a credit score is?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"Like a report card for money?"* ✅
2. *"Something that helps you borrow money?"* ✅
3. *"I have no idea!"* 😅

#### Educational Dialogue 1:
**Counselor:** *(After choices 1 or 2)* *"Exactly right! It's basically a number that tells lenders how trustworthy you are with money! Think of it like a reputation score! 🎯"*

**Counselor:** *(After choice 3)* *"No worries! A credit score is a number (usually 300-850) that shows how good you are at paying back money you borrow. Higher = better! Like a video game score! 🎮"*

### Quiz 1: Credit Score Basics
**Counselor:** *"Time for a pop quiz! What's considered a GOOD credit score?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"300-500"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Nope! That's actually poor credit. You'll need to work on it!"*)
2. *"500-650"* ⚠️ (Feedback: *"That's fair credit - not bad, but room for improvement! Aim higher!"*)
3. *"670-850"* ✅ (Feedback: *"YES! That's good to excellent credit! You're on fire! 🔥"*)

### Scenario 1: Credit Card Decision
**Counselor:** *"Imagine this: You just turned 18, and you got a credit card offer in the mail! The card has:*
- *0% interest for 6 months*
- *Then 25% APR (Annual Percentage Rate)*
- *$500 credit limit*
- *Cool rewards points!*

*What should you do?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"Get it, but only use it for emergencies and pay it off each month"* ✅ (Feedback: *"BRILLIANT! That's the smart way! You'll build credit AND avoid interest! 🌟"*)
2. *"Get it and use it for everything! YOLO!"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Whoa there! That's how debt spirals start! Only use it if you can pay it back immediately!"*)
3. *"Ignore it - credit cards are evil!"* ⚠️ (Feedback: *"Actually, credit cards are tools! When used wisely, they help build credit! Just be responsible!"*)

### Educational Content: Interest Rates
**Counselor:** *"Let's talk about INTEREST - the price of borrowing money! Think of it like a rental fee for using someone else's money! 💸*

*Here's the thing: Interest rates can sneak up on you!*

*Example: If you borrow $1000 at 20% APR and only pay the minimum ($25/month), you'll pay over $1,800 total! Yikes! 😱*

*The lesson? Pay off your balance in full each month when possible!"*

### Quiz 2: Debt Payment Strategy
**Counselor:** *"You have two debts:*
- *Credit Card A: $500 balance, 20% APR*
- *Credit Card B: $1000 balance, 15% APR*

*You can pay $200 this month. What's the smartest strategy?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"Pay both equally - $100 to each"* ⚠️ (Feedback: *"Not bad, but there's a smarter way! Always pay minimums on both, then focus on the higher interest rate!"*)
2. *"Pay minimum on Card B ($25), put rest ($175) on Card A"* ✅ (Feedback: *"PERFECT! You're using the 'Avalanche Method' - targeting high interest first saves the most money! 🎯"*)
3. *"Just pay Card B - it has the bigger balance"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Balance size doesn't matter as much as interest rate! Higher interest costs you more over time!"*)

### Scenario 2: Student Loan Reality
**Counselor:** *"Here's a real scenario: You need to pay for college. You have options:*
1. *Scholarships & Grants (free money!)*
2. *Federal Student Loans (lower interest, flexible repayment)*
3. *Private Loans (higher interest, less flexible)*

*What's the BEST strategy?"*

**User Choices:**
1. *"Apply for scholarships first, then federal loans, private as last resort"* ✅ (Feedback: *"BINGO! That's exactly the right order! Always exhaust free money first! 🏆"*)
2. *"Just get whatever loan is easiest"* ❌ (Feedback: *"Easy isn't always smart! Federal loans have better protections and lower rates!"*)
3. *"Skip college, who needs it anyway?"* ⚠️ (Feedback: *"Education is valuable, but there are many paths! Just make sure whatever you choose doesn't leave you drowning in debt!"*)

### Tips Section:
**Counselor:** *"Credit & Debt Pro Tips:*
1. *💳 Pay credit card balances in FULL each month*
2. *📅 Never miss a payment - it kills your credit score!*
3. *📊 Check your credit report annually (it's free!)*
4. *🎯 Focus high-interest debt first (Avalanche Method)*
5. *🚫 Don't max out credit cards - keep usage below 30%*
6. *💪 Build emergency fund BEFORE taking on new debt*
7. *🔍 Read the fine print - know what you're signing!*

*Remember: Good credit = More opportunities = Better life! 🌟"*

### Final Encouragement:
